# Victoria 3 Tweaks
This modpack is created to solve some trivial problems in Victoria 3's game play including
- Limited barrack and naval base levels, this restricts the upper limit the military of a country can have. Some countries in Victoria 3 are divided into much larger states (like Russia or China) than the west european countries. This should solve the problem that these countries can't form big enough military just due to amount of states.
- Nitrogen fixation production method would cost a lot of sulfur in the late game, and in the real world, nitrogen fixation was meant to produce ammoniak from coal related products and using iron as catalysator without sodium nitrate. By changing the input of this PM, much less sulfur would be needed.
- Navy now should use actual fuel.
